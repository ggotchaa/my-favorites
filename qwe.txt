TS2352: Conversion of type 'Record<string, unknown>' to type 'BiddingReportHistoryEntry' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'Record<string, unknown>' is missing the following properties from type 'BiddingReportHistoryEntry': id, biddingReportId, customerName, biddingMonth, and 15 more. [plugin angular-compiler]
