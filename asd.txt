src/app/services/auth-state-signals.service.ts:312 Unreachable statement

Description
An unreachable statement almost always indicates missing code or a latent bug and should be examined carefully.

Recommendation
Examine the surrounding code to determine why the statement has become unreachable. If it is no longer needed, remove the statement.

Example
In the following example, a spurious semicolon after the if condition at line 2 makes the return statement on line 4 unreachable: the function will always execute the return statement on line 3 first, so it will never reach line 4.


function f() {
	if (someCond());
		return 23;
	return 42;
}
To correct this issue, remove the spurious semicolon:


function f() {
	if (someCond())
		return 23;
	return 42;
}







--------------Upgrade vite from 6.3.6 to 6.4.1 to fix the vulnerability.

Description
Summary
Files denied by server.fs.deny  were sent if the URL ended with \ when the dev server is running on Windows.

Impact
Only apps that match the following conditions are affected:

explicitly exposes the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option )
running the dev server on Windows
Details
server.fs.deny can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes .env, .env.*, *.{crt,pem} as such patterns). These patterns were able to bypass by using a back slash(\). The root cause is that fs.readFile('/foo.png/') loads /foo.png.
