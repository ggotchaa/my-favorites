#2076038 Missing rate limiting (js/missing-rate-limiting) High


An HTTP request handler that performs expensive operations without restricting the rate at which operations can be carried out is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.


Description
HTTP request handlers should not perform expensive operations such as accessing the file system, executing an operating system command or interacting with a database without limiting the rate at which requests are accepted. Otherwise, the application becomes vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks where an attacker can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive by issuing a large number of requests at the same time.

Recommendation
A rate-limiting middleware should be used to prevent such attacks.

Example
The following example shows an Express application that serves static files without rate limiting:


var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/:path', function(req, res) {
  let path = req.params.path;
  if (isValidPath(path))
    res.sendFile(path);
});
To prevent denial-of-service attacks, the express-rate-limit package can be used:


var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// set up rate limiter: maximum of five requests per minute
var RateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
var limiter = RateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // max 100 requests per windowMs
});

// apply rate limiter to all requests
app.use(limiter);

app.get('/:path', function(req, res) {
  let path = req.params.path;
  if (isValidPath(path))
    res.sendFile(path);
});
